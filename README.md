# ðŸŽ® 2048 Game in C++

This is a university project that implements the popular **2048 puzzle game** in C++, featuring **two distinct approaches**:

1. **Procedural Version** â€” A straightforward, function-based implementation (`zaidimas.cpp`).
2. **Object-Oriented Version (OOP)** â€” A more modular design using classes (`OOP.cpp`).

Both versions are playable via the terminal, offering the core 2048 gameplay mechanics along with a simple AI autoplay feature.
